#### Hi there in this simple project I covered how to download different types of files by using simple <a> anchor tag.

#### All you need to add some download functionality ( wanna provide facility to download special file/video/image etc)

#### here is a syntax

a href = "path of the files" download = "name of the file"

#### but here is one important note the html file & download files both should be in the same directory.

#### Also there is many other techniques to make this download technique possible but I think this HTML5 anchor

### tag functionality is very simple & easy to use but here is a further detail if you wanna check other methods click this link
